        <h2>Core AI Topics</h2>

        <h3>1. Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Machine learning (ML)</span> is a subset of AI that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: This is the most common type of ML, where the model is trained using labeled data. For instance, a dataset containing images of cats and dogs is labeled with their corresponding labels (cat, dog). The model learns to map input data (the images) to the correct output (the labels).</li>
            <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: In this approach, the model is given data without explicit labels and must find patterns on its own. For example, clustering algorithms can group customers based on similar purchasing behaviors, without predefined categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to maximize long-term rewards. RL is commonly used in gaming, robotics, and autonomous systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Deep Learning: Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Deep learning</span> is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep"). Deep learning models can handle vast amounts of data and automatically discover patterns without human intervention.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neural Networks (NN)</strong>: These are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure.
